# Video: Texturing and UVs Overview

[![ProBuilder Texturing and UVs Overview Video](../images/VideoLink_YouTube_768.png)](@todo)

Texturing is the process of applying materials ("textures") to an object, and adjusting the Offset, Rotation, and Tiling of the object's UVs.

## Auto-Texturing vs Manual UVs

<div class="info-box warning">
Section Video: <a href="@todo">Texturing and UVs: Auto-Texturing vs Manual UVs</a>
</div> 

ProBuilder provides both "Automatic" and "Manual" Texturing methods:

* [Auto-Texturing](@todo) : Use this for simple Texturing work, especially architectural or hard-surface items. Tiling, Offset, Rotation, and other controls are available, while ProBuilder automatically handles the actual UV work.

* [Manual UV Editing](@todo) : Use a full UV Editor to precisely unwrap and edit UVs, render UV Templates, project UVs, and more.

You can also use a mix of Auto-Texturing and Manual UVs, even on the same object. This is especially useful when some parts of a model need to have tiling textures, while others are unwrapped.

To open this window, click it's button in the [Main Toolbar](@todo).

### (A) Toolbar

General tools for working in both [Auto-Texturing](@todo) and [Manual UV Editing](@todo) modes. The buttons are, from left to right:

* **Select, Move, Rotate, Scale** : this first group of buttons contains shortcuts to the standard Unity manipulation modes. Clicking these will have the exact same effect as clicking on the main Unity toolbar buttons.

* **Vertex, Edge Face** : the second button group contains shortcuts to ProBuilder's [Element Editing Modes](@todo). When using [Manual UV Editing](@todo), this allows you to select and manipulate UVs by Vertex, Edge, or Face.

* **In-Scene Controls** : This button toggles On/Off the [In-Scene Controls](@todo).

* **Texture Preview** : When **On**, the selected face's main texture will be displayed in the [UV Viewer](@todo).

* Render UVs: Opens the [Render UVs](@todo) tool panel, for rendering UV Templates to paint over in Photoshop/etc.
