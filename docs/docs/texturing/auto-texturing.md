Use the standard Move, Rotate, and Scale tools for texturing, or direct numerical input, and ProBuilder automatically handles all the complex UV work.

## In-Scene Controls

This is the simplest method of Texturing in ProBuilder. Using Unity's standard Move, Rotate, and Scale tools, you can directly manipulate Texturing per-face.

Here's a step-by-step example of using the In-Scene Texturing Controls:

1. Open the [Texturing and UVs Window](@todo)
1. If the [Use In-Scene Controls](@todo) button is greyed out, click to enable
1. Select a face, or multiple faces, to edit
1. Make sure the selected face(s) are using Auto-Texturing - if the [Texturing and UVs Tool Panel](@todo) shows a "[Convert to Auto-Texturing](@todo)" button, click that button
1. Use the standard Unity Move, Rotate and Scale tools- notice that instead of editing the face's geometry, it is now editing Offset, Rotation, and Tiling
1. Close the Texturing and UVs Panel when finished

> Snap to increments while Moving or Rotating by holding `CTRL` . You can customize these increment values via the [ProBuilder Preferences](@todo)

When you need to set an exact Offset, Rotation, or Tiling amount, use the [Texturing and UVs Panel](@todo).

Here's a step-by-step example of using the Panel Controls:

1. Open the [Texturing and UVs Window](@todo)
1. Select a face, or multiple faces, to edit
1. Make sure the selected face(s) are using Auto-Texturing - if the [Texturing and UVs Tool Panel](@todo) shows a "[Convert to Auto-Texturing](@todo)" button, click that button
1. In the [Texturing and UVs Tool Panel](@todo), type in exact values for Offset, Rotation, and Tiling.
1. You can also "drag" the values to smoothly increase or decrease
1. Close the Texturing and UVs Panel when finished
