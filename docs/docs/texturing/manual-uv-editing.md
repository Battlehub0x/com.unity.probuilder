ProBuilder is controlled almost entirely via the **Main Toolbar**, which contains all commonly used functions.

A second toolbar, the **Edit Mode Toolbar**, is available to quickly switch betweeen editing modes. This toolbar can always be found floating at the top-middle of your currently active sceneview.

## Overview: Texturing

Texturing is the process of applying materials ("textures") to an object, and adjusting position, rotation, and tiling.

![(new cube -> applied material -> rotated -> scaled -> offset)]

## Overview: UVs

UVs are used track these position, rotation, and tiling values. ProBuilder provides 3 methods of working with UVs:

* Auto UVs : Use the standard Move, Rotate, and Scale tools for texturing, or direct numerical input, and ProBuilder automatically handles all the complex UV work.

* Manual UVs : Use the full UV Editor to precisely unwrap and edit UVs, render UV Templates, project UVs, and more.

* Combination : Use a mix of Auto and Manual UVs, even on the same object.
