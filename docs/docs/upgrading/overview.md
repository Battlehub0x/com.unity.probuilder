<h2>Important!</h2>
The upgrade process is <b>not</b> reversible. If an error occurs, you will lose all your work. Always make a backup of your entire project before upgrading.
</div>

If you are using **ProBuilder 2.4.7** or later (you can check in the **Tools > ProBuilder > About** window) you can skip this entirely and just import the new version.

If you're running an older version of **ProBuilder** you'll need to follow a slightly more complex path.  **Make a backup of your entire project before proceeding!**

Depending on the version of ProBuilder you currently have installed, the process differs.  Use this chart to decide which guide you should follow.
