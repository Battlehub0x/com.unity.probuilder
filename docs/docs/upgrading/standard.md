If you're upgrading from version 2.4.7 or higher (either ProBuilder Basic or ProBuilder Advanced), updating a ProBuilder project is as simple as importing the new package.  

There are some circumstances where this will fail however, so always be sure to make a backup prior to upgrading your project.  In the event that simply importing the new package fails, follow this the [DLL Rename Upgrade](dllrename.md) guide.
