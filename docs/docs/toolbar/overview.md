All of ProBuilder's geometry functions can be found in the "ProBuilder Toolbar". 

This is a "smart" toolbar, and dynamically changes to match your current editing method and selection.

You can choose between a Text-Based interface, or Icons, and each button has custom, highly detailed tooltops, which are a great way to begin learning the Toolbar.
