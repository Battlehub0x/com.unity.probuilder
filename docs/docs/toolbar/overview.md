# Main ProBuilder Toolbar

All of ProBuilder's geometry functions can be found in the "ProBuilder Toolbar". 

This is a "smart" toolbar, and dynamically changes to match your current editing method and selection.

You can choose between a Text-Based interface, or Icons, and each button has custom, highly detailed tooltops, which are a great way to begin learning the Toolbar.

## Extra: Edit Mode Toolbar

This is actually an extension of the main Toolbar, and is located separately, at the top-middle of your active sceneview.

Use this "mini-toolbar" to choose your Edit Mode, or use keyboard shortcuts: 

* "Escape" to exit back to Object mode
* "G" to toggle in/out of the Geometry editing modes
* "H" to toggle through the available Element modes (Vertex, Edge, and Face)
