# Video: Toolbar Overview

[![ProBuilder Toolbar Video](../images/VideoLink_YouTube_768.png)](@todo)

ProBuilder is controlled almost entirely via the **Main Toolbar**, which contains all commonly used functions.

A second toolbar, the **Edit Mode Toolbar**, is available to quickly switch betweeen editing modes. This toolbar can always be found floating at the top-middle of your currently active sceneview.

### Main Toolbar

This is a "smart" toolbar, and dynamically changes to match your current editing method and selection.

You can choose between a Text-Based interface, or Icons, and each button has custom, highly detailed tooltops, which are a great way to begin learning the Toolbar.

### Edit Mode Toolbar

This is actually an extension of the main Toolbar, and is located separately, at the top-middle of your active sceneview.

Use this "mini-toolbar" to choose your Edit Mode, or use keyboard shortcuts: 

* `Escape` to exit back to Object mode
* `G` to toggle in/out of the Geometry editing modes
* `H` to toggle through the available Element modes (Vertex, Edge, and Face)
