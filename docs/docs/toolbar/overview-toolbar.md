[![ProBuilder Toolbar Video](../images/VideoLink_YouTube_768.png)](@todo)

ProBuilder is controlled almost entirely via the **Main Toolbar**, which contains all commonly used functions.

A second toolbar, the **Edit Mode Toolbar**, is available to quickly switch betweeen editing modes. This toolbar can always be found floating at the top-middle of your currently active sceneview.

This is a "smart" toolbar, and dynamically changes to match your current editing method and selection.

</div> 

Some of the most-used actions ([Extrude](@todo), [Collapse](@todo), [Grow Selection](@todo), etc) also include Custom Settings, which can significantly modify the action.

![Options Icon](../images/icons/options.png) This symbol is shown next to a button if there are Custom Settings available. To edit these settings, `ALT CLICK` on the button.

### Edit Mode Toolbar

<div class="info-box warning">
Section Video: <a href="@todo">Toolbar Overview: The Edit Mode Toolbar</a>
</div> 

This is actually an extension of the main Toolbar, and is located separately, at the top-middle of your active sceneview.

Use this "mini-toolbar" to choose your Edit Mode, or use keyboard shortcuts: 

* `Escape` to exit back to Object mode
* `G` to toggle in/out of the Geometry editing modes
* `H` to toggle through the available Element modes (Vertex, Edge, and Face)
