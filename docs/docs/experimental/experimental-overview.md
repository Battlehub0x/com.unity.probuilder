ProBuilder has some additional features that are considered "experimental."  

These are features that are either close to being complete, or complete with some caveats.

By default **Experimental Features** are disabled.  To enable experimental features:

- Open Unity Preferences (`Edit / Preferences` on Windows, `Unity / Preferences` Mac)
- Under the **Experimental** header, enable **Experimental Features**
