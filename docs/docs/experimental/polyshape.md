**Poly Shape** is unlike the usual ProBuilder shapes in that it is interactive and editable indefinitely.  Once a **Poly Shape** has been created you may continue to edit it's control points and other settings.

Modifying control points or settings will clear any mesh edits.

## Quick Start

- In the [ProBuilder Toolbar](../toolbar/overview-toolbar.md) select **New Poly Shape**.
- In the Scene View click to add control points.  These will form the outer bounds of your mesh.
- Once finished placing points, hit `Enter / Return` or `Space` to finalize the shape.
- Move the mouse up and down to set the mesh height, then `Left Click` to finalize.

After the initial path and height setting, the mesh enters **Editing Mode**.

## Editing a Poly Shape

Even after the initial creation steps a **Poly Shape** can still be modified.

Select the **Edit Poly Shape** button in the **Unity Inspector**.  To disable Poly Shape Editing simply click this button again.
