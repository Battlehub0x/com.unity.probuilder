**ProBuilder** has a number of tool windows that provide access to features like primitve creation, object mirroring, UV editing, and so on.

**ProBuilder** offers two flavors of interface: a text version, and an icon-only version.  They both provide the same access to functionality, so which one you use is a matter of preference.
