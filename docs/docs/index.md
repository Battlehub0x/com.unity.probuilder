## What is ProBuilder?

[Video Overview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nomx1LNk7r8) 

**ProBuilder** is an editor extension that enables you to seamlessly build, edit, and texture custom geometry, directly in the Unity editor, with an extremely fluid and intuitive workflow. It's a mixture of old-school "BSP-style construction", and full-featured 3D modeling and UV Unwrapping toolsets.

## ProBuilder Advanced vs. ProBuilder Basic

**ProBuilder Basic** is the core of ProBuilder, streamlined to the necessities for speed and simplicity.  Using Basic, you can quickly build great looking early-stage structures, props, walls, bunkers, vehicles, virtually anything at all. Test and tweak instantly, then replace with final models once your artists catch up- if they can!  ProBuilder Basic includes the ability to quickly colorize faces without adding a single draw call, so you can designate team areas, or just get creative with colorful dev textures.
