Which package do I install?

If you are using Unity 4.7 or lower:

ProBuilder2-v2.6.2f1-unity4

If you are using Unity 5.0, 5.1, or 5.2:

ProBuilder2-v2.6.2f1-unity50

If you are using Unity 5.3 or 5.4:

ProBuilder2-v2.6.2f1-unity53

If you are using Unity 5.5 or higher:

ProBuilder2-v2.6.2f1-unity55


If you would like to install the source code instead of a precompiled DLL (for any version of Unity):

ProBuilder2-v2.6.2f1-source
