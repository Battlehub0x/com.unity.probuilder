This does mean you won't be able to access any of the ProBuilder API at runtime.  Fortunately if you're just using ProBuilder to build levels you don't need to worry about that.   Steps to Fix    First make sure that  Strip PB Scripts on Build  is checked in the Preferences/ProBuilder panel.     Next, locate  ProBuilderCore-Unity5.dll  and  ProBuilderMeshOps-Unity5.dll  in your project.     With both  ProBuilderCore-Unity5  and  ProBuilderMeshOps-Unity5  selected, in the Inspector window uncheck \"Any Platform.\"  Then toggle both \"Editor\" and \"Standalone.\"     If you're using ProBuilder 2.5 or lower, some errors will appear when scripts reload.  Open the following files (in ProBuilder/API Examples):   IcoBumpin.cs  HueCube.cs  RuntimeEdit.cs   In each of these files, place this line at the very beginning:  #if UNITY_EDITOR || UNITY_STANDALONE  and this line at the very end:  #endif  For example, here's what  RuntimeEdit.cs  looks like:  #if UNITY_STANDALONE || UNITY_EDITOR\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing System.Collections;\nusing ProBuilder2.Common;\n\nnamespace ProBuilder2.Examples\n{\n\n    /**\n     *  \\brief This class allows the user to select a single face at a time and move it forwards or backwards.\n     *  More advanced usage of the ProBuilder API should make use of the pb_Object- SelectedFaces list to keep\n     *  track of the selected faces.\n     */\n    public class RuntimeEdit : MonoBehaviour \n    {\n        // ... etc\n    }\n}\n#endif  Now compile your project and run!",
