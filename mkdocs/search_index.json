This includes all ProBuilder scripts, so if you are making use of the runtime API you will need to disable this feature.\n\n\nDisable Auto UV2 Generation\n\n\nGenerating a UV2 channel for meshes is necessary for lighting, but can be a time consuming operation.  If you are editing objects with large vertex counts it is beneficial to skip generating the UV2 channel after every geometry edit and do it manually (using the \nGenerate UV2\n toolbar item).\n\n\nShow Scene Info\n\n\nShow or hide the mesh information overlay in the top left of the Scene View.\n\n\nShow Editor Notifications\n\n\nThis preference enables or disables notification popups when performing actions.\n\n\nToolbar Settings\n\n\nUse Icon GUI\n\n\nToggles the toolbar between using Icons or Text.\n\n\nShift Key Tooltips\n\n\nIf enabled the ProBuilder toolbar will only show tooltips when the mouse is hovering an item and the \nShift\n key is held.\n\n\nBy default tooltips are shown when the mouse hovers an action for more than a second.\n\n\nToolbar Location\n\n\nControls where the \nElement Mode Toolbar\n is shown in the Scene View.\n\n\nUnique Mode Shortcuts\n\n\nIf Unique Mode Shorcuts is enabled ProBuilder assigns the \nG, H, J, K\n keys to \nObject\n, \nVertex\n, \nEdge\n, and \nFace\n modes respectively.  You can change which keys are mapped to these actions in the Shortcut Settings section.\n\n\nBy default ProBuilder assigns the \nG\n key to toggle between \nObject\n mode and \nVertex/Edge/Face\n modes.  \nH\n toggles between the different element modes \nVertex/Edge/Face\n.\n\n\n*More Info on Modes: \nObject and Element Modes\n;\n\n\nOpen in Dockable Window\n\n\nIf enabled the ProBuilder toolbar will be opened as a dockable window.  If disabled the window will be floating and always on top.\n\n\nResource Defaults\n\n\nDefault Material\n\n\nWhat material new shapes will be instantiated with.\n\n\nDefault Entity\n\n\nWhat entity type new shapes will be instantiated as.\n\n\nDefault Collider\n\n\nThe type of collider new shapes will be instantiated with.\n\n\nForce Convex Mesh Collider\n\n\nIf the default collider is \nMesh Collider\n, this setting controls the \nIs Convex\n setting of the collider.\n\n\nMiscellaneous Settings\n\n\nLimit Drag Check to Selection\n\n\nWhen enabled ProBuilder will restrict drag selection of elements to the current selection.  If disabled drag selecting in a scene will test every ProBuilder object, which may be slow in larger scenes.\n\n\nOnly PBO are Selectable\n\n\nIf enabled while ProBuilder is open only ProBuilder created GameObjects may be selected.\n\n\nClose Shape Window After Building\n\n\nIf enabled the \nShape Tool\n will automatically close itself after a new object is created.\n\n\nDimension Overlay Lines\n\n\nHide or show the bounding lines in the Dimensions Overlay.\n\n\nGeometry Editing Settings\n\n\nPrecise Element Selection\n\n\nThis controls how close to an element the cursor must be to register for selection.  By default this is disabled, meaning that vertex and edge selection are very forgiving when clicking.\n\n\nIf enabled, the selectable area for vertices and edges is smaller, but you may also select faces by clicking outside of vertices.\n\n\nColors\n\n\nProBuilder allows users to set the colors for element selections.\n\n\n\n\n\nVertex Handle Size\n\n\nDetermines how large vertex points are rendered in the scene.  This setting does not affect selection.\n\n\nForce Pivot to Vertex Point\n\n\nWhen instantiating new shapes ProBuilder will guarantee that the pivot point of the object coincides with a vertex position.\n\n\nForce Pivot to Grid\n\n\nWhen instantiating a new object ProBuilder will snap the object to the nearest grid point (as determined by ProGrids).\n\n\n\n\nBridge Perimeter Edges Only\n\n\nWhen enabled ProBuilder will not allow users to extrude edges from manifold edges.  Disable to remove this restriction.\n\n\nExperimental\n\n\n\nWarning! Enabling experimental features may break your project!  Please exercise caution.\n\n\n\n\nMeshes Are Assets\n\n\nProBuilder will store mesh information in the Project instead of per-scene.\n\n\nUV Editing Settings\n\n\nUV Snap Increment\n\n\nSet the snap increment in the UV Editor window.\n\n\nEditor Window Floating\n\n\nMake the UV Editor window floating or dock-able.",
